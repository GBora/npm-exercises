# npm-exercises
Small set of exercises for the npm presentation during the internship

Each exercise is it's own site with it's own `package.json` file which you will tipically need to modify in order to complete it.

## Exercise 1

a) This site utilises Bootstrap, as can be seen from it's `index.html`.

Opening the html directly in the browser shows it to be unstyled.

Your task will be to figure out why this is the case and fix it, proof of completion will be a screenshot of the site being rendered correctly in the browser.

b) Add any library you like to this project (feel free to search on npm).

Proof of completion will be the modified `package.json` file

## Exercise 2

This site utilises a library, but the site itself isn't working as intended.

Fix it, proof of completion will be the modified version of the file you needed to fix.

## Exercise 3

This site utilises npm scripts to generate it's needed css and js.

Generate these files and send a screenshot of them in the folder they were compiled to.
